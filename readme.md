# Nodebots workshop at SpaceApps hackathon

Hardware & software mesh up.

NodeJS & Arduino = fun!

## What we will do

Built a speech powered light, that you can control by saying `on`, `of` and `blink`.

This workshop serves as a foundation to explore Nodebots. Maybe you can use it to built something for the hackathon.

## Steps

* Blink a light;
* control your light from a web browser;
* speak to your light and it listens.
